Ryan Burns' User Story

The database hase been created in Google's cloud firestore. 
I've created two collections:
  1. users
      >Priority
      >Product
      >Quantity
      >UID
      >deleted
      >purchased
  2. userlists
      >email
      >name
      >state

I am working on getting a user to store the shopping list from the client side. 
It will work by a user entering their credentials and store their items in a user list.
