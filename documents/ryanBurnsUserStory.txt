Ryan Burns' User Story

The database hase been created in Google's cloud firestore. 
I've created two collections:
  1. userlist
      >Priority
      >Product
      >Quantity
      >UID
      >deleted
      >purchased
  2. users
      >email
      >name
      >state

The user will store the shopping list from the client side. 
It will work by once a user enters their credentials and gain access to their list page they can store their unique items to cloud firestore.
